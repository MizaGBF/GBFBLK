# Granblue Fantasy Blocker  
Block a few elements from loading when playing the game.
Currently the following:  
- The Mobage sidebar javascript file (imported the [Mobage Sidebar Blocker](https://github.com/MizaGBF/Mobage-Sidebar-Blocker)).  
- The Shop Premium Pass and "Featured" images, rendering the button invisible.  
  
Like the [Mobage Sidebar Blocker](https://github.com/MizaGBF/Mobage-Sidebar-Blocker), it's Manifest V3 compliant.
