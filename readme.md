# Granblue Fantasy Blocker  
Block a few elements from loading when playing the game.
Currently the following:  
- The Mobage sidebar javascript file (imported from my [Mobage Sidebar Blocker](https://github.com/MizaGBF/Mobage-Sidebar-Blocker)).  
- The Shop menu Premium Pass and "Featured" images, rendering the button invisible.  
- In the same way, the Shop menu Special package images when they are available, rendering the button invisible.  
- The Shop menu Separator images, resulting in a more compact shop menu.  
  
Like the [Mobage Sidebar Blocker](https://github.com/MizaGBF/Mobage-Sidebar-Blocker), it's Manifest V3 compliant.  
  
### Disclaimer  
Use or modify it at your own risk.
  
### Know issue  
Blocking the sidebar has the side effect to change the position of pop-ups and such. There is no solution to this issue, beside getting used to this new behavior.  
  
### Usage  
Download this repo (Code button > Download ZIP) and unzip the archive somewhere.  
In a Chromium browser: Extension menu > enable Dev mode > load unpacked > select the folder containing those files.
